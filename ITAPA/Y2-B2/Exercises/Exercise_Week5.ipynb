    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Create a simple TCP client and server where the client sends a temperature in degrees Celsius, and the server converts it to Fahrenheit and sends it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a TCP server that listens on 127.0.0.1 and port 65432.\n",
    "2. The server should accept a connection from a client, receive a temperature value in degrees Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit, and send the converted value back.\n",
    "3. Write a TCP client that connects to the server, takes a user input for the temperature in degrees Celsius, sends it to the server, and prints the server's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for converting degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{Fahrenheit} = \\text{Celsius} \\times \\frac{9}{5} + 32 $"

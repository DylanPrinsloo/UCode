    "## Overview\n",
    "Concurrency is a technique that allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously, making efficient use of system resources and improving the performance of applications. In Python, concurrency can be achieved using processes and threads. This lesson will introduce you to these concepts, explain their differences, and provide examples of how to implement them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the concepts of concurrency, processes, and threads.\n",
    "2. Differentiate between processes and threads.\n",
    "3. Implement concurrency using the `multiprocessing` and `threading` modules in Python.\n",

    "       pass\n",

    "   ```python\n",

    "5. **Optionally, use `join()` to wait for the thread to complete**:\n",

    "    Within the print_numbers function, we use a with lock: statement to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute the code inside\n",

    "    We create and start multiple threads as before, passing different arguments to each thread.\n",

    " - Wait for Threads to Complete:\n",
    "    We wait for all threads to complete using thread.join().\n",

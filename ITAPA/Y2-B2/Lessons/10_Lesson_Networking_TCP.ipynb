    "\n",
    "#### Sockets\n",
    "- Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network. They provide a way for applications to communicate over a network, using standard protocols like TCP and UDP. A socket is defined by an IP address and a port number, which together uniquely identify a network connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AF_INET\n",
    "- AF_INET stands for \"Address Family - Internet\". It specifies the address family for IPv4. When creating a socket, `AF_INET` is used to indicate that the socket will use the IPv4 protocol for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOCK_STREAM\n",
    "- SOCK_STREAM is used to specify a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) socket type. TCP sockets are connection-oriented, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications. When you use `SOCK_STREAM`, you are creating a socket that supports TCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOCK_DGRAM\n",
    "- SOCK_DGRAM is used to specify a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) socket type. UDP sockets are connectionless, providing an unreliable, unordered, and error-prone way of sending datagrams (discrete packets of data). When you use `SOCK_DGRAM`, you are creating a socket that supports UDP.\n"

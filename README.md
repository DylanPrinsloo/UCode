# University-Code

This Repository was put together for the common goal of creating a collective code repository. The code below was required for completing a 3-year 
BSc in Computer Science at my University . The `folder` is still being updated every week. Content will still be missing and hence I have incorparated external work to keep content as updated as possible. Every subject will have a `Lessons` folder containing all the code required for learining and a `Problems` folder for the Subjects has a small projects or questions for that class.

_Some Content from the degree are not code related, or are not needed or not finished_ 

[All University-Math will be here](https://github.com/DylanPrinsloo/University-Math.git)
